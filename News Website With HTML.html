        However, Virat Kohli is set to play the two-match Test series which begins with the Boxing Day game in Centurion;
         No clarity yet on Rohit Sharma's participation in white-ball games during tour of South Africa.
         Virat Kohli, the highest run getter at the recently-concluded World Cup, will not be available for selection for the white-ball games during India’s tour of South Africa, which begins with a T20 International on December 10 in Durban.
    Kohli has informed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) of his decision to take a break. India will play three T20 internationals, three ODIs, followed by two Test matches during the tour of South Africa.
    
    Kohli, however, is set to feature in the Test matches, The Indian Express understands.</b>

    <b><q> The silence at Guwahati as Glenn Maxwell smoked the final delivery of the match for a boundary, with two needed off that ball in Australia’s chase of 223, said everything about the evening for India. Despite making their third successive total of 200-plus (222/3), courtesy a spellbinding unbeaten 123 by Ruturaj Gaikwad, another 
     special knock from Maxwell – a 48-ball 104 – helped Australia keep the series alive with two matches to go.
     For India, this was a night where their batsmen and bowlers showed the road they had to take in the lead-up to the next T20 World Cup in June-July.</b></q>

<h3>Will Shubman Gill become a Gujarat Titan in his new role as captain in IPL?</h3>
<img src="D:\Abhishek\45C9E1-360.gif" width="200" height="100">
<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>
    <p style="color:rgb(18, 19, 18);">With captaincy experience in only a handful of matches under his belt, Shubman Gill will now lead Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League. With Hardik Pandya moving back to Mumbai Indians, Gill has been appointed skipper of Titans,
        the same franchise that took a punt on Pandya, who had only led in Under-16 cricket.
   In comparison to Pandya, Gill has more captaincy experience. The 24-year-old has led Punjab in two T20s,
    India A in six List A games and has also captained in four first-class matches, all of them in 2019.
